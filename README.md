# assembler
This assembler (+disassembler) implementation processes sixteen basic assembly instructions, performs full input validation, supports user-defined labels, and has an option to specify the assembly program name and a custom comment.

## Build

#### 1. Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/armmam/assembler.git
cd assembler
```

#### 2. Build

```
make
```

## Usage

```
./asm assembly_program
```

If you want to use the disassembler, run the program with `-d` option:

```
./asm -d machine_code
```

## Format

An example of a valid input file (`ex.s` from `example/` directory at the root of this repo)

```
.name "A program name"

.comment "A comment containing program description"


loop:
        sti r1, %:live, %1
live:
        live %0
        ld %0, r2
        zjmp %:loop
```

When passed to the assembler, the file gets processed and the program outputs another file that contains machine code representation of the input file. It can then be executed directly (e.g. by a [virtual machine](https://github.com/dm-alexi/corewar_vm)).

Any invalid input invokes a corresponding error that specifies the number of the line where the error occurred and the line itself. For instance,

```
Error: Expected separator at line 7
        "        sti r1 %:live, %1"
```

was invoked by a missing comma after the first argument of `sti` instruction.
